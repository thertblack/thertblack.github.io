              <p class="hero__subtitle">
               I’m RT Black, and before I ever wrote stories, I was a student who slowly watched his creativity being boxed in. School taught us to follow rules, to write the way we were told — not the way we felt. Every time I forced myself to fit into that system, a part of my passion faded. I know what it means to have your spark dulled, your freedom restricted, your thrill for creation taken away. That’s why I speak about reigniting passion and creativity — because I had to rebuild my own from the ground up.

              <p>
                In a world full of stories, I found myself no longer excited — reading and watching just to escape boredom. That’s when I realized what I truly missed: the thrill of getting lost in a world, the joy of seeing characters come together, and the heartbreak when they drift apart.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, I decided to create the story I was searching for — one that makes readers feel everything. My goal is to craft unforgettable worlds that pull you in so deeply, you won’t want to put the book down.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because to me, words are far more than letters strung together. They can open doors, heal wounds, spark emotions, and even reignite forgotten love. Words carry the power to transport us to another world, to mean nothing and everything at the same time. 
              </p>
              <p>
                That is why I do what I do — because behind every word lies a story worth sharing. And mine begins with these words: “Let me tell you a story.”

                My mission is simple: to write stories that make people feel. To thrill, inspire, and even ignite passion. I want my words to reach readers in a way that stays with them long after the story ends — to move hearts, spark emotions, and awaken imagination. I will not simply write on paper, I will write into your heart!

              I’ve always loved creativity, for creativity is freedom — beauty in its purest form. At my core, storytelling has always been my driving force, whether through letters, movies, poems, or spoken word. It didn’t matter the form; what mattered was the emotion, the memories it stirred. And what makes me feel most alive right now is the story I’m working on: The One Uniting: Era of Monsters

                Drin, a dedicated police officer, leads a life that seems ordinary on the surface—but nothing about it is truly normal! When a bizarre and supernatural case disrupts the city, Drin crosses paths with SMO, a secret organization that handles otherworldly phenomena. After aiding them in the investigation, Drin finds himself pulled into a hidden world teeming with monsters and ancient powers. What starts as a single case soon becomes the beginning of a new life—one that will challenge everything what Drin thought he knew. Yet, Drin himself is only part of something much bigger!
